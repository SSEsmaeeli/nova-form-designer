## Installation
Same as most other Nova Packages

```
composer require eom-plus/nova-form-designer
```

## Usage
It's in very early development stage. All PR's are welcome. Hope that the Nova's community can help into making this tool production ready.

It can be very useful for end users that need to create their own forms or to use to create custom fields per model.
Most of CRM system has such feature.
